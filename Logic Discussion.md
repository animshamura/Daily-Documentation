<h1>Logic Discussion :</h1>

<h2>☐ To create n square numbers of n digits. <br/></h2>
<h4>1, 6 and 9 are going to be used here. <br/> <br/>
  Firstly there would be 169 and (n-3) 0s correspondingly <br/> <br/>
  Then, a loop has to be run n/2 times. <br/> <br/>
  Each time simply execute (1 + i times 0s + 6 + i times Os + 9 + (n- 2i - 3) times 0s) <br/> <br/>
  and (9 + i times 0s + 6 + i times Os + 1 + (n- 2i - 3) times 0s). <br/> </h4>

<h2>☐ You can find an array of integers can form a target integer. <br/></h2>
<h4>You will have some integers those are not mentioned.<br/><br/>
It's as simple as it is. You got to find the multiplication of the given integers. <br/><br/>
Then, if the result is a factor of the target integer then you can find the rest integers. <br/><br/>
